\section{Research Experience}

\cvitem{}{
I have developed my research career in the field of experimental high energy physics, working in the ATLAS experiment at the LHC accelerator at CERN. I was awarded with a FPU grant and obtained my PhD from the Universidad AutÃ³noma de Barcelona in 2015 with Cum Laude honors. 
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ttH(bb)
\cvitem{Run~1:}{
Throughout my career, I have worked on physics analyses targeting different aspects of the hierarchy problem. During my PhD I was the lead analyser for the first searches for ttH, which led to the confirmation of the SM-like nature of the top Yukawa coupling~\cite{HIGG-2013-27}. I then transitioned to searches for beyond-the-standard-model top partners, that could cancel the top-loop corrections to the Higgs mass. I developed the first search for vector-like tops decaying to Higgs bosons, covering for the first time the full spectrum of possible decays~\cite{EXOT-2013-18}. I also performed a search for supersymmetric top partners, targeting the production of the heavier stop and the subsequent decay to the lightest stop and Higgs boson ($\tilde{t}_2 \rightarrow \tilde{t}_1 H$)~\cite{SUSY-2014-07}.
}
\cvitem{}{
During this period I also worked on the characterisation and calibration of the timing performance of the Tile calorimeter using collision data. I identified multiple detector and geometrical effects that were previously not accounted for, and introduced a set of selection cuts and corrections that improved the resolution of the time measurement by up to 20\%~\cite{TCAL-2017-01}. 
}

\cvitem{{RPC SUSY}}{
After my PhD I obtained a CERN research fellowship. During this time, I led a series of searches for scalar top partners, redesigning the search for a much better performance. The strong sensitivity and flexibility of the analysis led to a series of publications with integrated luminosities of 3.2~fb$^{-1}$\cite{SUSY-2015-02}, 14 fb$^{-1}$\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2016-050} and 36 fb$^{-1}$\cite{SUSY-2016-16}, with increasingly comprehensive coverage of stop production within natural SUSY scenarios. As recognition of my work I was appointed convener of the third-generation supersymmetry group.  
}

\cvitem{Trigger}{
Alongside physics analysis, I have been heavily involved in the trigger group where I have contributed to the operation, development and design of the trigger menu, which defines the data that is recorded by ATLAS. I was appointed as trigger menu and signature coordinator, and as such I was part of the Trigger Coordination board, as well as the Physics Coordination board, the most important body in ATLAS concerning all topics related to the physics research programme. In this position I was in charge of the physics, detector, and signature trigger subgroups, comprising more than a hundred members. I also had the pleasure of defining the Run 3 ATLAS trigger menu, shaping the physics programme of the experiment for next years. 
}
\cvitem{{RPV SUSY and LLPs}}{
I am currently CERN research staff, and during the last years I have transitioned to less common new physics searches, such as supersymmetric models with R-parity violation (RPV), or models with long-lived particles. I have developed a new search covering a gap in coverage pointed out by theorists, in the final state of one lepton and many jets~\cite{SUSY-2016-11}. In the second iteration, I introduced state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, that allowed to reach sensitivity to electroweak production. The analysis provides the first limits on higgsinos decaying via RPV since LEP~\cite{SUSY-2019-04}.}
\cvitem{}{
During this period I was appointed convener of the R-parity violating and long-lived supersymmetry group. I also initiated a taskforce to explore the interplay of RPC analyses, prompt RPV analyses, and long-lived searches~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2018-003}. I am currently LHC LLP working group convener, where I coordinate the work of theorists and experimentalists studying long-lived particles across LHC experiments.
}

\cvitem{{BSM Higgs}}{
Possible additional decays of the Higgs boson are still compatible with current measurements, with branching ratios of up to $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$, as well as additional bosons from extended Higgs sectors. I have contributed to the design and optimisation of an analysis targeting the decay of the Higgs boson to two light pseudo-scalars, which in turn decay to pairs of b-quarks~\cite{HDBS-2018-47}. 
In addition, I am currently working on an analysis targeting models where the heavy Higgs sector can exhibit flavour-changing neutral currents. This kind of models feature a rich phenomenology, and can produce yet unexplored signatures such as three-top production.
}

\cvitem{Run~3}{
As part of my effort to improve the Run 3 triggers, I am currently coordinator of the Level-1 calorimeter algorithm and performance forum, where I am leading efforts to develop and optimise reconstruction and identification algorithms, in order to achieve the best possible performance out of the trigger phase-I upgrade.
}
\cvitem{}{
In summary, throughout my career in ATLAS I have performed measurements and searches within the Top, Higgs, Exotics and SUSY groups, targeting different aspects of the hierarchy problem. I have also contributed strongly in the Tile calorimeter and in the Trigger groups. During this time I have been entrusted with several management and coordination roles with an increasing level of responsibility and leadership, and proved my ability to lead large research groups in an international environment.
