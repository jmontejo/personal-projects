% Till has waaaay more past included in the cover letter
% Highlight the importance of the current moment in the 
% also waaay more vague. Should simply stress the need for challenging-natural-SUSY searches

To whom it may concern,
\newline

I am writing to apply for the Experimental Physicist position at CERN.
I am currently working on the ATLAS experiment as CERN LD staff. During my period in ATLAS I have performed measurements and searches within the Top, Higgs, Exotics and SUSY groups. I have also contributed strongly in the Tile calorimeter and in the Trigger groups. 
\newline

As a scientist working in high energy physics, my desire is always to explore the frontiers of our knowledge. The possibility of working for CERN represents being on the cutting edge of science and technology, and the best place to push the limits of fundamental science.
During my years as CERN fellow and staff, I had the incredible opportunity of collaborating and learning from some of the best physicists, which I personally consider one of the most valuable aspects of working in a collaboration.
%In this field, where the collaborations have grown bigger and each member has progressively become more specialized in a particular aspect, being part of a team with some of the best researchers ensures a global view of the whole field. In such situation, all the members benefit from the the discussion and interchange of ideas. 
%I would definitely enjoy working in such an international environment, and as an addition, having the possibility of communicating the state of the art of particle physics to the general public through outreach activities.
The planned LHC and detector upgrades, as well as ongoing studies for future accelerators, make the next years an exciting opportunity to shape the future of CERN, and high-energy physics.
\newline


%With the energy increase of Run 2, I focused on BSM searches, which benefited the most from the increased centre-of-mass energy. Considering the null results from Run 2 searches, coupled with the lack of a significant increase in energy of future runs, I consider well motivated a change of my focus towards measurements where dedicated efforts can improve the precision of our results.
%It is also important to keep in mind that so far less than 5\% of the target of 3000 fb$^{-1}$ has been recorded, and the successful completion of the phase-II upgrades is required to ensure this is achieved. This is a challenge that I would like to undertake, in order to contribute to a timely completion of the upgrade, and I consider it an exciting opportunity to shape the future of ATLAS.
%\newline
I firmly believe my experience across several analysis and detector groups in the ATLAS experiment, as well as the experience in several management and coordination positions, would make me a very positive addition to the CERN group. 
\newline

Enclosed are my curriculum vitae, including a list of publications, and a research
statement. Please let me know if there are any other materials or information that will assist you in
processing my application.
\newline

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.
\newline

Sincerely,
