To whom it may concern,
\newline

I am writing to apply for the scientist staff position in particle physics with the ATLAS experiment.
\newline

I am currently working on the ATLAS experiment as CERN staff. During my period in ATLAS I have performed measurements and searches within the Top, Higgs, Exotics and SUSY groups, focusing on final states with top quarks. I have also participated in activities in the Tile calorimeter and in the trigger group. 
\newline

With the energy increase of Run 2, I focused on BSM searches, which benefited the most from the increased centre-of-mass energy. Considering the null results from Run 2 searches, coupled with the lack of a significant increase in energy of future runs, I consider well motivated a change of my focus towards measurements where dedicated efforts can improve the precision of our results.

It is also important to keep in mind that so far less than 5\% of the target of 3000 fb$^{-1}$ has been recorded, and the successful completion of the phase-II upgrades is required to ensure this is achieved. This is a challenge that I would like to undertake, in order to contribute to a timely completion of the upgrade, and I consider it an exciting opportunity to shape the future of ATLAS.
\newline

I believe my passion for working in a collaborative environment, coupled with my experience in several groups in the ATLAS experiment, and the shared interest in terms of physics program would
make me a very positive addition to the ATLAS group at IRFU.
\newline

Enclosed are my curriculum vitae, including a list of publications, and a research
statement. Please let me know if there are any other materials or information that will assist you in
processing my application.
\newline

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.
\newline

Sincerely,

\vfill
