This PhD thesis is focused on the search for new phenomena in top-antitop quark (\ttbar) final states with additional $b$-quark jets at the LHC. 
It uses the full Run 1 dataset collected by the ATLAS experiment in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} =\unit[8]{\tev}$. 
The final state of interest consists of an isolated lepton, a neutrino, and at least six jets with at least four $b$-tagged jets, 
a challenging experimental signature owing to the large background from \ttbar+heavy-flavor production. 
This final state is characteristic of \ttH\ production, with the Higgs boson decaying into \bbbar, a process that allows directly probing the top-Higgs Yukawa coupling. 
This signature is also present in many extensions of the Standard Model that have been proposed as solutions to the Hierarchy Problem, such as Supersymmetry or Composite Higgs models, which predict the pair production of bosonic or fermionic top quark partners, or the anomalous production of four-top-quark events. 
All these physics processes have been searched for. An ambitious search strategy has been developed, building on a combination of state-of-art theoretical predictions and a sophisticated statistical analysis to constrain in-situ the large background uncertainties. 
As a result, some of the most restrictive bounds to date on the above physics processes have been obtained.
