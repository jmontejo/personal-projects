\section{\texorpdfstring{Search for \ttH\ production}{Search for ttH production}}
The measurement of the production \xsec\ of the \ttH\ process allows probing directly the top Yukawa coupling.
Indirect constrains on the coupling can be extracted through the measurement of the Higgs production rates~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2015-007}, 
although with strong assumptions: only SM particles contribute to the loops (see figures~\ref{fig:eff_vtx_ggH} and~\ref{fig:eff_vtx_Hgaga}) and the total Higgs boson width is fixed to the SM value.
A precision of \unit[20]{\%} on the top Yukawa coupling is achieved through this indirect measurement.

The direct measurement of the coupling through the tree-level \ttH\ process (see figure~\ref{fig:eff_vtx_ttH}) allows removing the assumption, in order to disentangle possible new physics contributions in the effective $ggH$ and $\gamma\gamma H$ vertices.

\subsection{Event selection and categorization}
After the preselection described in section~\ref{sec:preselection}, the events are categorized in different channels
depending on the number of jets (4, 5 and $\geq$6) and on the number of $b$-tagged jets (2, 3 and $\geq$4).
This categorization allows separating signal-rich regions at high jet and $b$-tag multiplicity from the dominant \ttbar+jets background.
However, after the categorization it becomes very difficult to devise further selection cuts that would allow the suppression of the irreducible \ttbb\ background. One of the characteristics that could allow differentiating the signal from the background is the resonance produced by the decay $H \to \bbbar$. However, the identification of the correct \bbbar\ pair is not trivial, since there are six possible ways of assigning a \bbbar\ pair to the Higgs boson from the four $b$-tagged jets. Previous results in the search for \ttH, $H\to\bbbar$ have followed this approach~\cite{ATLAS2011ttH}, performing a kinematic fit of the final state in order to identify the \ttbar\ system and the Higgs boson candidate. The correct \bbbar\ pairing is only achieved approximately $\unit[20]{\%}$ of the times, while the other $\sim \unit[80]{\%}$ a wrong pairing is chosen,\footnote{A wrong pairing can also be due to acceptance effects, where the products from the Higgs boson decay are not present in the event.}
therefore diluting the expected peak in a combinatorial background.
The matching performance and the expected $m_{\bbbar}$ distribution in \pp\ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = \unit[7]{\tev}$ is shown in figure~\ref{fig:klf_mbb}.
Given the difficulties to isolate the Higgs boson resonance, no selection cut is attempted on this observable. This feature will however be used later in the construction of the discriminant variable.

  boson (labeled as ''all partons matched``). In all instances angular matching is performed by requiring $\DR <0.4$.

  \label{fig:klf_mbb}
\end{figure}

The presence of a leptonic $W$ boson is usually exploited in \ttbar\ final states in order to reduce the non-\ttbar\ backgrounds. Selection cuts on kinematics variables such as \met\ or \mtw\ are a common choice, however in the search for \ttH\ these cuts are not included. 
Considering the small \xsec\ of the \ttH\ process, and since 
the efficiency of the cuts is very similar for the signal and the \ttbar\ background, the introduction of these cuts results in a reduction of the sensitivity. This conclusion is reached easily when the sensitivity is estimated as $S/\sqrt{B}$, but it has been also verified with the full systematic model.
The suppression of the non-\ttbar\ backgrounds is already achieved through the requirement of high $b$-tag multiplicity, therefore no further cuts are applied in order to maximize the signal acceptance.

\subsection{Discriminant variable: artificial neural networks}
Given the difficulty to increase the purity of the signal-rich regions, the sensitivity has to be optimized introducing a powerful discriminating variable. 
Artificial Neural Networks (NN) are used to discriminate potential signal events 
from the background. 
They are particularly useful in cases where no single variable exhibits a 
clear separation power between signal and background.
A NN allows combining the information from several input variables into one output discriminant that exploits the correlations among the variables and can reproduce a non-trivial selection in the variables' phase space.
The present analysis is an ideal ground for the application of such a 
multivariate approach given the large number of physics objects in the 
final state.

specific jet multiplicity (4, 5, $\geq$6), and the columns show the
$b$-jet multiplicity (2, 3, $\geq$4). Signal-rich regions  
are shaded in dark red, while the rest are shown in light blue. 
The $S/B$ ratio for each region is also noted. 
}
  \label{fig:soverb}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:soverb} shows the expected $S/\sqrt{B}$ per analysis region, with the signal-rich regions highlighted in red. Three different NNs are trained in the most sensitive regions: \fivefour, \sixthree\ and \sixfour, to discriminate the \ttH\ signal from the background.
A fourth NN is trained in the \fivethree\ region, to 
separate the two most relevant backgrounds to the analysis: \ttbar+light-jets and \ttHF\ production.
This NN is useful to gain further precision in the measurement of the \ttHF\ background.

The rest of the regions considered in the analysis have a very low
sensitivity and the variable of choice is $\hthad$, defined as the scalar sum of jet \pt.
This variable is chosen due to its sensitivity to the background modeling and to systematic uncertainties such as jet energy scale or $b$-tagging, which have a clear \pt\ dependence.
The signal-depleted regions have high data statistics and the fit of $\hthad$ allows controlling the impact of systematic uncertainties primarily affecting \ttbar+light-jets events.

Figures~\ref{fig:prefit_ttH_1} and~\ref{fig:prefit_ttH_2} show the comparison of data and prediction for the $\hthad$ and NN distributions in each of the analysis
channels considered. The corresponding predicted and observed yields per channel can be found in table~\ref{tab:Prefit_EventsTable_lj}.

\subsection{Fit results}
\label{subsec:fit_ttH}
A fit to the data in the nine analysis regions is performed under the signal-plus-background hypothesis, and the fitted NP are shown in figure~\ref{fig:ttH_fit}.
For each NP, the fitted value represents the preferred shift with respect to the nominal prediction in units of its prior uncertainty, 
whereas the fitted error represents the post-fit uncertainty in units of the prior uncertainty. 
The corresponding correlation matrix for the
fitted NP can be found in figure~\ref{fig:corrmat_ttH}.
The fitted value for the signal strength is: $\mu= 1.2 \pm 1.3$, and the expected uncertainty for the signal strength (assuming $\mu = 1$) is $\pm 1.2$.

Figures~\ref{fig:postfit_ttH_1} and~\ref{fig:postfit_ttH_2} show the comparison of data and prediction for the $\hthad$ and NN distributions
in each of the regions considered, after the fit to data.
Compared to the pre-fit distributions, the total background uncertainty is significantly
reduced after the fit, not only in the background-dominated channels, but also in the signal-rich
channels, resulting in an increase in the search sensitivity. The reduced uncertainty results from the significant constraints on some
systematic uncertainties, as well as the anti-correlations among sources of systematic uncertainty 
resulting from the fit to the data.
The corresponding post-fit yields per channel can be found in table~\ref{tab:Postfit_EventsTable_lj}.

A good agreement is found between data and prediction in all channels. The good performance of the fit can further be validated through comparison between data and total prediction for other kinematic distributions. Pre-fit and post-fit distributions for different distributions can be found in appendix~\ref{app:DataMC_validation_ttH}. 
The agreement for other kinematic distributions not used in the fit is also improved
after the fit, giving confidence in the overall procedure.

Given the regions considered in the fit, some of the NPs are expected to be constrained by the data and possibly pulled, 
in particular those associated with large uncertainties on $t\bar{t}$ modeling. 
The most relevant pulls and constrains are discussed in the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item JetModel1: the largest eigenvector after diagonalization of the modeling uncertainties in the in-situ calibration of the jet energy scale.
    The effect of this uncertainty is shown in figure~\ref{fig:control_JetModel1} for the \ttbar+light jets process in the \fourtwo\ region. It produces a $\sim \unit[4]{\%}$ effect in the bulk of the distribution, and up to $\sim \unit[10]{\%}$ in the lower tail. The high data statistics in this region, of up to 30000 events in one bin, doesn't support such big variations and therefore the uncertainty is constrained. %Main contribution to modeling comes from full difference between Pythia and Alpgen+Herwig in modeling Z-pT
  \item JetFlavComp: the uncertainty on the jet flavor composition. Since the jet energy response is different for quark-initiated jets than for gluon-initiated jets~\cite{Aad:2014gea}, analyses with a different flavor fraction than the sample used to derive the jet energy scale calibration are affected by this uncertainty. The effect of the negative pull is an increase in the low tail of the distribution, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:control_JetFlavComp}, which corrects the disagreement at low $\hthad$ in the \fourtwo\ region. It has been checked that the pull disappears when removing this region from the fit and, given that this systematic uncertainty is not correlated with the signal strength, this pull is not problematic. 
  \item JVF: the jet vertex fraction uncertainty is constrained to about half of its pre-fit effect. The uncertainty was assessed by changing the JVF cut as to cover data/MC differences in a sample with one single jet. In this analysis the simultaneous variation of the JVF cut for all the jets in the event produces a large variation that is not supported by data and is therefore constrained.
  \item JER: the jet energy resolution uncertainty is constrained to about half of its pre-fit effect. This constrain originates from the conservative approach used to estimate the uncertainty for low-\pt\ jets as mentioned in section~\ref{subsec:JER}. Since the bulk of the contribution originates from low-\pt\ jets this uncertainty can be reduced with the selected data sample. The effect of the jet energy resolution on the \ttbar+light-jets sample in the \fourtwo\ region is shown in figure~\ref{fig:control_JER}.
  \item $c$-tagging eigenvector 3: this corresponds to the largest eigenvector after diagonalization of the $c$-tagging uncertainties. The region \fourthree\ is very sensitive to the $c$-tagging uncertainty (see figure~\ref{fig:control_Ctag3}) since its main contribution comes from \ttbar\ events where a charm quark from the hadronic $W$ decay is tagged. The high statistics of this region allows the reduction of the uncertainty, which was derived on a sample of $D^{*+}$ events. The use of $c$-quarks from $W$ decays in \ttbar\ events is in fact a method that is in consideration for future $c$-tag calibrations.
  \item $b$-tagging eigenvector 5: this uncertainty corresponds to the largest eigenvector after diagonalization of the $b$-tagging uncertainties. It introduces a $\sim \unit[2]{\%}$ variation per $b$-tagged jet that is amplified to $\sim \unit[8]{\%}$ in the 4 $b$-tag regions. The simultaneous fit of different $b$-tag multiplicities allows reducing this uncertainty.
  \item QCD electron: the \unit[50]{\%} normalization uncertainty on the electron component of the multijet prediction. This pull has been traced to be originated from individual bins in the very low tail of the $\hthad$ distributions. Introducing cuts on \met\ or \mtw\ reduces the multijet component and doesn't alter significantly the result of the fit, however it reduces the sensitivity of the search. Given the negligible contribution of the multijet background and that it has no impact on the signal this pull is not considered problematic.
  \item ttbar DataRw-IFSR: the variation on the \ttbar\ reweighting due to the systematic uncertainty associated to initial- and final-state radiation in the differential \xsec\ measurement. Out of the nine components of the reweighting this uncertainty has the largest effect on the \ttbarpt\ spectrum, which propagates to the reconstructed jet multiplicity. This variation is not supported by the data and can be constrained. This constraint is in fact expected since the differential \xsec\ measurement is performed with the 7 \tev, which has a factor of four less statistics than the dataset used for this analysis. Other components of the \ttbar\ reweighting such as the choice of MC generator or the fragmentation model are also slightly constrained. The impact of this systematic uncertainty on the \ttbar+light-jets sample in the \fourtwo\ region is shown in figure~\ref{fig:control_IFSR}.
  \item ttbar PartonShower: the three NPs related to the choice of fragmentation model are pulled and/or constrained and deserve further attention. The NP affecting \ttbar+light jets is heavily constrained and fitted at its nominal value. The fitted value indicates that data supports the prediction of \PP. The prediction of \powheg+\herwig\ is in disagreement with data in the high-statistics channels and, since the full difference to \PP\ is taken as systematic uncertainty, the fit constrains the allowed variation to a smaller range. The effect on the \ttbar+light-jets sample in the \sixtwo\ region is shown in figure~\ref{fig:control_PS}.

    The NP related to \ttbb\ is in agreement with the nominal prediction, indicating that NLO prediction of \ShOL\ agrees with data. The effect of the fragmentation uncertainty is again too large and data can constrain this systematic uncertainty to a fraction of its pre-fit value.

    The pull on \ttcc\ is difficult to study since there is no NLO prediction to compare to and both predictions, \PP\ or \powheg+\herwig\, could be equally valid. The only anecdotal evidence supporting this pull is that the \ttC\ component in \powheg+\herwig\ is \unit[40]{\%} higher than in \PP, thus the pull towards \powheg+\herwig\ would introduce the same effect as the leading correction on the \ttB\ component, where the NLO prediction is observed to be \unit[40]{\%} higher than in \PP.
  \item ttbb normalization: the normalization of the \ttbb\ component is fitted to a value $\sim \unit[30]{\%}$ higher than its nominal prediction, and the uncertainty is reduced from the very conservative \unit[50]{\%} to \unit[20]{\%}. The data statistics in the \sixfour\ region allows reducing the uncertainty, therefore improving the sensitivity of the search. 

    The normalization uncertainty of the \ttcc\ background is also reduced, although to a smaller extent since there is no region where it is the dominant background.

Other systematic uncertainties are not discussed since their pulls and constrains are less significant or they don't affect appreciably the sensitivity of the analysis. 

Figure~\ref{fig:ranking_ttH} demonstrates the effect of various systematic uncertainties on
the fitted value of $\mu$ and the constraints provided by the data. 
The largest effect arises
from the uncertainty in normalization of the irreducible \ttbb\ 
background, even after being reduced to half of 
the initial \unit[50]{\%}.
The \ttbb\ modeling uncertainties affecting the 
shape also have a significant effect on $\mu$, with four of them
among the highest-ranked systematic uncertainties.

post-fit uncertainties, $\sigma_{\theta}$, which are close to 1 if the data do not provide

\subsection{Limits on \ttH\ production}
Following the methodology discussed in chapter~\ref{chapter:Statistics}, the $p_0$-value is computed in order to test the compatibility of data with the background-only hypothesis. 
The observed (expected) $p$-value for the background-only hypothesis is \unit[15]{\%} (\unit[16]{\%}), which corresponds to an observed (expected)  significance of 1.0 (1.0) standard deviations. Since no significant excess over the background-only hypothesis is found, a \unit[95]{\%} CL upper limit can be set on the signal strength modifier. A signal 3.6 times larger than predicted by the SM is excluded at \unit[95]{\%} CL. A signal 2.6 times larger than the SM prediction is expected to be excluded if no SM \ttH\ process exists.

Figure~\ref{fig:SBordered_lj} summarizes post-fit event yields as a function of $\log_{10}(S/B)$, for all bins of the distributions used in the fit. The signal is normalized to the fitted value of the signal strength ($\mu = 1.2$) and a signal 3.6 times larger than predicted by the SM, which is excluded at \unit[95]{\%} CL, is also shown.

The \tth\ signal is shown both for the best fit value ($\mu = 1.2$) and for the upper limit at 95\% CL ($\mu=3.6$).}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Analysis combination}
A complementary search for \ttH\ ($H \to \bbbar$) in the dileptonic channel has also been performed in ATLAS~\cite{Aad:2015gra}. The analysis procedure in the dileptonic channel is completely equivalent, and given that the datasets are orthogonal, the combination of both analyses can be performed.
A combined fit is performed to the nine regions of the single lepton search and six regions from the dilepton search. The result of the fit is shown in figure~\ref{fig:fit_ttH_combined}, and a good agreement in the fitted values is observed between the individual and the combined analyses.

The observed $\mu$ values for the
single-lepton and dilepton searches, and their combination, are shown in figure~\ref{fig:fittedmu}. 
The fitted signal strength for 
the combined analysis is:
\begin{equation}
\mu  = 1.5 \pm 1.1~.
\end{equation} 
The observed (expected) significance of the signal is 1.4 (1.1)
standard deviations, which corresponds to an observed (expected) $p_0$-value of 8\% (15\%).   

The observed and expected limits
for both searches 
and their combination are shown in figure~\ref{fig:limits}. A signal 3.4 times larger than 
predicted by the SM is excluded at 95\% CL using the CL$_{\rm{s}}$ 
method. 
A signal 2.2 times larger than the SM prediction is expected to be excluded in the absence of the \ttH\ process, 
and 3.1 times larger than the SM prediction if the \ttH\ process is present with SM strength.  
The combination improves the expected sensitivity by \unit[15]{\%} respect to the single-lepton search alone.
The \unit[95]{\%} CL exclusion limits with their corresponding error bands are also summarized in table~\ref{tab:LimitsVSAnalysis}.

Finally, figure~\ref{fig:logSBplot} summarizes the post-fit event yields as a function of $\log_{10}(S/B)$, 
for all bins of the distributions used in the combined fit of the single-lepton and dilepton channels.

\subsection{Comparison with other analyses}
Searches for the \ttH\ process have also been performed in ATLAS in the diphoton~\cite{Aad:2014lma} and multilepton~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2015-006} final states. 
The expected exclusion limits are 4.9 and 2.4 times the SM prediction, respectively.
The combination of the three analyses: \bbbar, diphoton and multilepton, has also been performed in order to search for possible deviations in the Higgs couplings~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2015-007}, yielding an expected sensitivity of 1.4 times the SM prediction.
The individual fitted signal strengths and the combination of the three analyses are summarized in figure~\ref{fig:ttH_combo}.

A search for the 
associated production of the Higgs boson with a top-quark pair using  
several Higgs decay modes (including \htobb) has been published  
by the CMS Collaboration~\cite{CMS8TeVttH} quoting a ratio of the 
measured \tth\ signal \xsec\ to the SM expectation 
for a Higgs boson mass of \unit[125.6]{\gev} of $\mu = 2.8 \pm 1.0$.

The matrix element method was also used for a search in the \ttH, \htobb\ channel by the
CMS experiment~\cite{CMSMEM}. A second discriminating variable was defined to separate \ttHF\ from \ttbar+light-jets. The signal is extracted via a two-dimensional fit to both discriminants and the fitted signal strength is: $\mu = 1.2^{+1.6}_{-1.5}$.

The analysis described in this dissertation is the most sensitive search to date for the \ttH\ process.
