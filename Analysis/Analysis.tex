\label{chapter:Analysis}

This chapter presents three searches in \ttbar\ final states with additional heavy-flavor jets, probing physics processes related to the hierarchy problem. All searches share a common preselection, background description and systematic uncertainty model, as described in chapter~\ref{chapter:Modeling}. 
For each search, the event selection cuts, event categorization and the discriminant variable used are studied in detail and optimized based on the different features of the processes under investigation.

A search for the \ttH\ process is presented and is used to discuss the details of the profile likelihood fit. Searches for fermionic and bosonic top partners, as well as four-top production are also presented, which are used to set limits on several BSM models.
