summary: Basic introduction about MVA techniques
content: MVA techniques use the correlation among N variables to define a single discriminant which is sensitive to signal vs background.
Boosted/Bagged decision trees: builds up a binary tree, in each step you take a decision over a variable and a threshold. Variables can appear several times. At the end you get your event classified as signal or background.
Neural networks: one input layer with one neuron per variable, all possible connections to a second layer with the same number and connected to a final neuron. At the end, given N inputs you obtain one output close to 1 if it is signal-like.
The training of the network proceeds in steps, you monitor the difference of outputs over iterations, it decreases until you overtrain and get a step up.
In all methods you need a minimum of statistics to perform, if the discriminant distribution has spikes you are using too little mc.
The way to choose the best method is to plot signal efficiency vs 1-bkg efficiency. You want to go close to 1,1 and you select your method accordingly.
The mc is split into [[training,testing],rest for limit setting] don't mix up testing (to evaluate the performance of your training) and the part left for limits.
The usual number of variables is around 4, at the end you have a ranking of discriminating power. Inefficient variables can degradate the performance of NN but are not used in BDT.

Use BDT to check the discrimination of N variables. Pick up the best, check again in BDT and NN (which should perform slightly better)

summary: pdf mc
content: where I can find information of what PDFs were used to generate the various MC samples in the Top group?

the most secure way (I always use it when in doubt)  is to dq2-get input 
unit used for the sample production and read the PDF data from the 
.events file (e.g. Powheg) or .dat  (Alpgen, MC@NLO, Protos) card for 
the ME part . The PS is added within the Athena, so the PDF is set by 
the *common* file included in the jO file.

Take 105200 as a concrete example:
1) get a hold of jO file by (e.g.) following the clickable "DSID" link 
on the  twiki  pages  
https://svnweb.cern.ch/trac/atlasoff/browser/Generators/MC10JobOptions/trunk/share/MC10.105200.T1_McAtNlo_Jimmy.py
(alternatively, svn list the MC10JobOptions/trunk/share and grep/export 
105200)
2)the 7 TeV input unit is  
"group09.phys-gener.mcatnlo341.105200.ttbar_7TeV.TXT.v1"; if you dq2-get 
-n 1and unpack the input unit, the PDF used for the ME is in the .dat 
file, passed by the LHAPDF id: 10550 (CTEQ66)
3) for the PS part, the tune/PDF is specified in the *common* file  
https://svnweb.cern.ch/trac/atlasoff/browser/Generators/MC10JobOptions/trunk/common/MC10_McAtNloJimmy_Common_7TeV.py 

consulting it you see that "modpdf 10550" i.e. CTEQ66 (and the 
corresponding tune) is also used for the PS part

An alternative would be to make AMI evgen-level samples queries, which 
do return a PDF used for the PS part. AMI query can be made using AMI 
command line interface (see 
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasProtected/TopMC, the FAQ&A 
link How to find the sample cross-section and filtering efficiency? for 
setup instructions) or (e.g.) by clicking the "AMI link" in the twiki 
pages.
Taking 105200 for example again, the query link is:
https://ami.in2p3.fr/AMI/servlet/net.hep.atlas.Database.Bookkeeping.AMI.Servlet.Command?Converter=/AMIXmlToAMIProdHtml.xsl&Command=FormBrowseDatasetPerParameter+-datasetNumber=105200+-dataType=EVNT+-version=e598
+ click on the "details"; this leads you to an answer "CTEQ6.6" in the 
PDF field. The pitfall with the AMI queries is that you learn nothing 
about the  PDF used for the ME part , so in case the ME and PS use 
different PDFs (only the case for Powheg samples in MC10b), you'll still 
need to use the 1st "secure" option.

The  1st option is therefore warmly recommended since you might want to 
address matters like which generator tune, version and other parameter 
setups were used to generate the sample and this data is most reliably 
obtained from jO and inputs directly.
